<h2>Description</h2>
For our first year at the Design and Development of videogames degree in the Project 1 subject we had to replicate some classical fighting videogames. We chose Fatal Fury: King of fighters.
<h5> Fatal Fury: King of fighters </h4>
Fatal Fury King of fighters is a fighting videogame developed and published by SNK originally in 1991 for SNK's NEO GEO arcade machine MVS and not too much later for the home console version. This game has a lot of versions and sequels but we tried to replicate the original one.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

The final element.
