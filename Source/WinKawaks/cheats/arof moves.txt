Last update on 7/23/2003
  I added and corrected many things to make the FAQ more understandable 
and readable.

-------------------------------------------
A Word Before We Get Down To The Real Talk:
-------------------------------------------
  This FAQ has everything about Art of Fighting 2. If you are one of 
those who want everything in one FAQ then this is the right choice for 
you (though it will be hard since it will be pretty long)! ^_^

===================================================== 

  As the old guy said in that movie, "It's da fundamentals, my boy, da 
fundamentals dat's impotant (sic)."

  Whatever the old guy meant, we don't know but what we do know is that 
there are a variety of varicolored attacks and defenses in the new Art 
Of Fighting 2. In clutch battles and at long distance, your character 
must master a variety of unique attacks and methods of self-defense to 
crawl your way to the top. There vary with each character, so your 
concentration and study is required. (And you thought you could get away 
from concentration and study. Well, guess again!)

================================
Dash Attack and Flyback Retreat:
================================
  Quickly press the joystick forward twice to use the Dash Attack. 
Quickly pressing the joystick twice backward will allow you to jump back 
from your opponent. 

===============
Punch A Button:
===============
  Tapping the button will result in a light punch. Depressing the button 
will let you ruin your opponent's dental work with a super-powered 
punch.

==============
Kick B Button:
==============
  Tapping the button will result a light kick. Depressing the button 
will send your opponent into orbit with bombastic boot of marvelous 
destruction. But kids, please don't try this at home!

==============================
C+A Button Uppercut To Heaven:
==============================
  While pressing the C button, press the A button to deliver a painful 
uppercut to your opponent. Remember, aim for the head.

====================
C+B Button Low Kick:
====================
  While pressing the C button, press the B button to topple your 
opponent with really powerful low kick.

========================================
A, B, C, Button Recovering From Attacks:
========================================
  If Body Tossed by your opponent, push the A, B or C button using the 
proper timing to recover and land on your feet.

====================================
C Button Light Punch and Light Kick:
====================================
  Taking some distance between you and your opponent will allow you to 
smack or kick your opponent. Of course, you need to push the A or B 
button in combination. *Tap the A or B buttons for light attacks or use 
these buttons in combination with the C button. Use the C button and now 
strong kicks or punches for you, young man.

====================================
C Button Body Toss or Contact Moves:
====================================
  In close battle, press this button to grab your opponent and slam the 
impertinent whelp to the pavement. Judge your timing correctly or you 
could get smacked yourself. A hard move to pull off but when you do 
ooooh, what a feeling!

================
The Raz Buttton:
================
  Cut your opponent's Rage Gauge to render him or her impotent, in terms 
of psychic attacks, that is. While your opponent attempts to restore his 
or her power, he or she is totally defenseless, so you got it made! Push 
the D button to raz your opponent into ineffectiveness. 

=========================================
Psychic Attacks From The Arsenal of Ouch:
=========================================
  Based on certain combinations of joystick movement and buttons, your 
character can produce eye-popping attacks more powerful than punches and 
kicks. Each attack uses a certain amount of rage gauge power, so use 
these babies wisely.

=========================
Restoring The Rage Gauge:
=========================
  If the psychic power of your character shown by the Rage Gauge is 
depleted, your character can not use full-powered attacks. To restore 
your power, eat more yellow vegetables and carbohydrates before a match, 
or follow these simple steps: Smack down the A, B or C buttons and keep 
pressing on them until your Rage Gauge is restored.

=============================================

             Art of Fighting 2
                Prologue: 

  The ascetic warrior, Ryo Sakazaki. The pretty-boy rough guy, Robert 
Garcia. One year has passed since their adventures in the den of 
iniquity known as... Southtown. Saving Ryo''s sister Yuri and uncovering 
the mysterious secret of Mister Karate, they now wait for their next 
challenge. 

  Then, it comes. A mysterious summons from the hive of evil and 
treachery known as... Southtown. A mysterious figure has called our 
heroes, along with some of the toughest dudes and dudettes in the world, 
to the old neighborhood, the neighborhood of shadows and illusions, the 
neighborhood of despair and fear, the neighborhood known as, you guessed 
it... Southtown. 

  What secret lies behind this call to the contest known as "The King Of 
Fighters", a contest offering unheard of fame and wealth? Who will steal 
the laurels victory and what depth of wickedness will these laurels 
plunge the winner of this match of brawn and wits?

Story: 
  Scion of the creator of "Kyoku Gen Karate", Takuma Sakazaki, he has 
been passing the previous year since the rescue of his cute kid sister 
Yuri in the Japanese Alps, bathing in the frigid streams and dancing on 
the sharp rocks of Mt. Yuwannafaito. Hearing of the mysterious "King Of 
Fighters" competition, he ventures once again to his old hunting 
grounds.

+++++++++++++
Command List:
+++++++++++++
1)Tiger Flame Punch: Quarter circle forward + A
-
2)Flying Tiger Flame Punch: In the air... Quarter circle forward + A or 
B
-
3)Thousand Kick Crunch: Forward, backward, forward + A
-
4)Koho: Forward, down, down/forward + A
-
5)Lighting Legs Knock-Out Kick: Down/backward, forward + B
-
6)Kyokugenryu-Renbu-Ken: Quarter circle backward + A

+++++++++++
Super Move:
+++++++++++
7)Haoh Sho Koh Ken: Forward, half circle forward + A

++++++++++++++++++
Hidden Super Move: 
++++++++++++++++++
8)Ryuko Ranbu: Quarter circle forward, half circle backward + C

++++++++++++++
Beating Geese:
++++++++++++++
  When the match begins jump up to avoid Geese's Reppu Ken, he then will 
walk to you, walk to him and grab him then if he recovers the throw... 
do Haoh Sho Koh Ken and if not then do Tiger Flame Punch to make him get 
dizzy. And then recharage... then do everything over and over again 
until he suffers and dies. 

  If he jumps, just do standing hard kick. Do not do his Thousand Kick 
Crunch because it is a waste of good and needed Rage Gauge. Always go 
for something saver and better. Geese will go mad and try to jump 
again... just follow up with the standing hard kick and do not get 
confused by his madness. 

  If you do not control the match calmly with Ryo, you will be kicked 
out in no time. If you did what I told you above, then I think you did 
very good and I think that is the best strategy I can offer.   

  Geese does not defend Ryuko Ranbu, Haoh Sho Koh Ken, Flying Tiger 
Flame Punch (sometimes), Flying Tiger Flame Punch (sometimes) and 
Lighting Legs Knock-Out Kick. He defends Kyokugenryu-Renbu-Ken, Koho and 
Thousand Kick Crunch. Ryo will not be able to perform Koho, Thousand 
Kick Crunch, Haoh Sho Koh Ken and Ryuko Ranbu when he loses his Rage 
Gauge.

++++++++++++++++++++
Perfect Possibility:
++++++++++++++++++++
  There is a good possibility to win perfect by following the below 
method,
  
  When the match begins, fast crouch and Geese will throw a Reppu Ken at 
you, then break it by your crouching light kick and stay. He will charge 
and then do it over, over and over again. Just do the same... so he 
throws a Reppu Ken then you break it by crouching light kick, then he 
will recharge and throw another Reppu Ken and you will break it again by 
your crouching light kick and so on. 

  When the time at five seconds, fast when he performs his Reppu Ken, 
just perform your Lighting Leg Knock-Out Kick and then jump backward. 
And you will get the perfect... remember, one mistake and you will be 
out easily.   

  The possibility to get perfect is 64%

Blood Type: AB

Voice Actor: Key Inage

Story: 
  Son of the multi-zillionaire industrialist Albert Moralista Del Gusto 
De Braha Garcia. Robert has forsaken the wishes of his father, left the 
prestigious Emperor University, and has followed the pursuit of Kyoku 
Gen Karate mastership. The rival of Ryo, Robert is one fop who packs a 
wallop.

+++++++++++++
Command List:

++++++++++++++++++
Hidden Super Move: 
++++++++++++++++++
8)Ryuko Ranbu: Quarter circle forward, half circle backward + C

++++++++++++++
Beating Geese:
++++++++++++++
  Nothing hard with Robert. When the fight begins, jump back to avoid 
Geese's Reppu Ken. Then when Geese gets near you, He will then jump at 
you then distance hard kick... then either Flying Sawblade Slicer or 
Reppu Ken. Here, you have to be very very very focused in order to win 
perfect. It is less than a moment to perform Flying Sawblade Slicer or 
Reppu Ken, if he does Flying Sawblade Slicer, FAST A+C, and if the Reppu 
Ken then FAST crouching light kick. Okay with the Flying Sawblade Slicer 
case just run and throw him then Dragon Blast Punch. If he did not 
recover from the throw then do not perform the Special Move, just run 
toward and then crouching hard kick. He will not defend. Time your 
attacks... and then go with the same method. 

  If he performs Reppu Ken, then break it by crouching light kick and 
wait until he performs his Flying Sawblade Slicer then go with the above 
method. You will not feel tired because Robert throws his opponent near 
him, so you can fast run and then crouching hard kick, if Geese 
recovered from the throw that is... if not then perform Dragon Blast 
Punch.

  By that you can finish the match in no time. Also, Geese does not 
defend when you perform Flying Dragon God Kick, Dragon Blast Punch, 
Lighting Legs Knock-Out Kick, Haoh Sho Koh Ken and Ryuko Ranbu. He will 
either mash or by mistake defend... it depends on the distance between 
the both of you. Forget about his Ryuga, Great Spirit Kick and 
Kyokugenryu-Renbu-Ken. 

  If it is hard to time the A+C when Geese performs his Flying Sawblade 
Slicer, then when the match begins, stand still and Geese will perform 
his Reppu Ken, then jump up... Geese then will walk to you, you then 
walk to him and easily grab him. Then do the method above. A very easy 
one... you can do this with all the characters, so I will not bother to 
mention it everytime. 
  
  Robert will not be able to perform Great Spirit Kick, Ryuga, Flying 
Dragon God Kick, Haoh Sho Koh Ken and Ryuko Ranbu when he loses his Rage 
Gauge... that is why Robert is so underated. And his normals have no 
invincibilty. So you always have to recharge if you want to do Haoh Sho 
Koh Ken or Ryuko Ranbu. And remember, when Geese jumps, just do distance 
hard kick.


++++++++++++++++++++
Perfect Possibility:
++++++++++++++++++++
  The possibilility to get perfect with Robert is very high, it all 
depends on making Geese falls down so that you could get near him to do 
crouching hard kick or to throw him. There is another hard way to get 
perfect...

  When the match begins, fast crouch and Geese will throw a Reppu Ken at 
you, then break it by your crouching light kick and stay. He will charge 
and then do it over, over and over again. Just do the same... so he 
throws a Reppu Ken then you break it by crouching light kick, then he 
will recharge and throw another Reppu Ken and you will break it again by 
your crouching light kick and so on. 

  When the time at five seconds, fast when he performs his Reppu Ken, 
just perform your Lighting Leg Knock-Out Kick and then jump backward. 
And you will get the perfect... remember, one mistake and you will be 
out easily. 

  The possibility to get perfect is 100%.

7)Flying Phoenix Kick: Forward, backward, half circle backward + B+C

++++++++++++++
Beating Geese:
++++++++++++++
  It is a bit hard to beat Geese with this babe. But there are many 
strategies to beat him with her. 

  Jump back when the fight starts. Wait until he gets near you, when he 
performs his Flying Sawblade Slicer, fast throw him. Yuri sucks pretty 
much when it comes to throwing. She does a pose when she throws her 
opponent which gives her opponent the time to get up and not worry to 
make her get near him or her. So, you cannot run and then do crouching 
hard kick or Tiger Flame Punch. Geese will be up and then will make you 
sorry if you do so.

  So, just do her Super Move, Haoh Sho Koh Ken. He will not defend. Do 
not do her other moves. Focus on her Haoh Sho Koh Ken, Tiger Flame Punch 
and Flying Phoenix Kick. So go with the same method over and over again 
and when you have a little life bar, use her Flying Phoenix Kick. 

  Yuri will not be able to perform Slipstream Slap, Haoh Sho Koh Ken and 
Flying Phoenix Kick when she loses her Rage Gauge. Also Geese will not 
defend when you perform Tiger Flame Punch, Hoah Sho Koh Ken and Flying 
Phoenix Kick. And will defend Slipstream Slap, Kyokugenryu-Saiha, Enbu 
Kick and Raioh-Ken. And sometimes, he blocks Yuri's Tiger Flame Punch. 

++++++++++++++++++++
Perfect Possibility:
++++++++++++++++++++
  You can get get perfect by going with the same method I mentioned for 
Ryo and Robert.

  When the match begins, fast crouch and Geese will throw a Reppu Ken at 
you, then break it by your crouching light kick and stay. He will charge 
and then do it over, over and over again. Just do the same... so he 
throws a Reppu Ken then you break it by crouching light kick, then he 
will recharge and throw another Reppu Ken and you will break it again by 
your crouching light kick and so on. 

  When the time at five seconds, break the last Reppu Ken he performs 
and then perform her Tiger Flame Punch and fast go back. If you do not 
use the move right away, Geese will throw another Reppu Ken and it will 
take too much damage. So, no mistakes to get this perfect.

  The possibility to get perfect is 23%.

Story: 
  Pioneer of the Kyoku Gen school of Karate, Takuma enters the 
competition with an uneasy sense that something is just not adding up, 
because of his superior Southtown organization but refused. Could this 
competition be the work of his old enemies?

1)Tiger Flame Punch: Quarter circle forward + A

2)Lighting Legs Knock-Out Kick: Down/backward, forward + B

++++++++++++++
Beating Geese:
++++++++++++++
  Now you know how Geese perfectly plays and his good strategy, so no 
need to say everything over and over again.

  Takuma will have no trouble beating Geese. When the match begins, jump 
back and then DO NOT defend but be ready for a good attack, Geese will 
perform Flying Sawblade Slicer, fast do A+C... then fast if Geese 
recovers, crocuhing hard kick and if not then do Tiger Flame Punch.

  He will get dizzy, go very near him then do Haoh Sho Koh Ken, and the 
run and throw him before he gets up, then go with the above method. This 
will get one 100% perfect.

  Geese does not defend Tiger Flame Punch, Shoran-Kyaku, Haoh Sho Koh 
Ken and Ryuko Ranbu. And defends Lighting Legs Knock-Out Kick, Thousand 
Kick Crunch and Kishingeki. Takuma will not be able to perform Thousand 
Kick Crunch, Shoran-Kyaku, Haoh Sho Koh Ken and Ryuko Ranbu when he 
loses his Rage Gauge.

++++++++++++++++++++
Perfect Possibility:
++++++++++++++++++++
  You can get get perfect by going with the same method I mentioned for 
Ryo, Robert and Yuri.

  When the match begins, fast crouch and Geese will throw a Reppu Ken at 
you, then break it by your crouching light kick and stay. He will charge 
and then do it over, over and over again. Just do the same... so he 
throws a Reppu Ken then you break it by crouching light kick, then he 
will recharge and throw another Reppu Ken and you will break it again by 
your crouching light kick and so on. 

  When the time at five seconds, fast when he performs his Reppu Ken, 
just perform your Lighting Leg Knock-Out Kick and then jump backward. 
And you will get the perfect... remember, one mistake and you will be 
out easily. 

  Also there is a very hard method, when the match starts, jump back and 
wait for Geese to perform his Flying Sawblade Slicer and then do A+C... 
run and throw him before he gets up and when he gets up (if he did not 
recover the throw), do Tiger Flame Punch, then when he gets dizzy... raz 
him to take out all his Rage Gauge. Then perform his Shoran-Kyaku, if 
Geese defends then do it again and if not then recharage and then when 
he gets up, do it again... Geese will not attack when you recharge so be 
fast when he gets near you... fast do Shoran-Kyaku. Do this over and 
over again and he will be doomed. 

  If Geese gets very near you and you do not have Rage Gauge to perform 
Shoran-Kyaku, then wait for him to perform Flying Sawblade Slicer, then 
fast do A+C before he hits you and do everything over and over again. 

  The possibility to get perfect is 100%

  The former bouncer of La Maison, defeated by Ryo and Robert one year

honest living as a political consultant. Finding the trade perverse and 
inhuman, she has resurfaced on the streets, kick-boxing her way to a 
showdown with her old pals and hoping for the prize money. But for what

++++++++++++++
Beating Geese:
++++++++++++++
  King does not make the opponent falls down when she does crouching 
hard kick, so there is a good strategy to get perfect.

  When the match starts, jump back as always and wait for him to perform 
his Flying Sawblade Slicer, then when he performs it, do A+C then run to 
throw him... then perform Venom Strike TWICE to make him gets dizzy. 
Then recharge FAST and then run to throw him before he wakes from his 
dizziness. And do everything over and over again.

  When he is about to die, do her Double Strike. If it is hard for you 
to do the perfect method (will get perfect), then try to make your life 
bar so little to do her Hidden Super Move... 

  Just wait for Geese to do Flying Sawblade Slicer, then defend and then 
throw him away then perform her Surprise Rose. Then fast recharge and do 
Surprise Rose again. Geese will either recharge or tease you, so do not 
worry. A sure win.

  Geese will not defend (not always) when you do Venom Strike, 
Combination Attacks, Double Strike and Surprise Rose. And will defend 
when you do Trap Shot and Tornade Kick. She will not be able to perform 
Trap Shot, Double Strike and Surprise Rose when she loses her Rage 
Gauge. 

++++++++++++++++++++
Perfect Possibility:
++++++++++++++++++++
  There is a laughable staretgy to get perfect other than the one 
mentioned above.

  Just stand still and DO NOT move at all, when Geese performs Reppu 
Ken, break it by crouching light kick and do so everytime he performs 
it. When he walks to you walk to him and throw him (do not run, only 
walk). You can do Venom Strike twice to make him dizzy and go with them 
method again. 

  And if you want it to become more hard, then do not perform her Venom 
Strike, but instead when you throw him, wait again and until he walks to 
you or jumps... he will not attack if you throw him fast. Just remember, 
do not run, attack or do anything other than walking and throwing him. 

  The possibility to get perfect is 98%

++++++++++++++
Beating Geese:
++++++++++++++
  Ladies and gentlemen, this fight is one of the best in the game. The 
strategy here is so deep and anyone who could go with this strategy and 
get perfect, I am sure he will say as I said. 

  Temjin has a throw that cannot be recovered, which is down/backward or 
down/forward + C. It is better than backward or forward + C.

  So when the fight begins, DO NOT jump back, because Temjin's A+C will 
not take out Geese's Flying Sawblade Slicer. His hand is shorter than 
Geese's. So, you must do his Mongolian Tornade Dive VERY FAST when the 
match starts, Geese will surely raz you. So if you do not do it fast, 
you will get hit by his Reppu Ken and lose your chance to get perfect, 
because the start is very important. 

  So when you do his Mongolian Tornade Dive, you will not be able to hit 
him because you will be just near him and he is going to tease you. So, 
the trick is to get near him then fast down/forward + C to throw him, 
then run to get near him and do Wall of No Return. He will be dizzy, you 
can do this over and over again until he dies.

  If it is hard, then do the normal throw then run to him, if he did not 
recover then run and Wall of No Return... perform it near him and very 
near, because if you do not then he will crouch hard kick and you will 
trade hit and lose the perfect. So very near to make him dizzy and then 
do it over and over again.

  If he recoves, fast run then crouch hard kick... here he will either 
defend it or not, if not then run again and throw him to do the above 
method. If he defended the crouch hard kick, then you MUST do either Big 
Discus Bash or Mongolian Thunder Drop to grab him right after his 
crouching hard kick. So you do crouching hard kick and then Mongolian 
Thunder Drop or Big Discus Bash to grab him, if Geese did not defend 
then he will not grab him and if he did then he will grab him. 

  Yes, Temjin can grab you if you defend his normals... also, he can 
grab after his Super move is defended. Pretty much scary. His Big Discus 
Bash takes a lot of damage, can finish off the opponent if performed 
three times and on Geese four times. 

  If you suck pretty much and you are so lously, then only defend and 
when Geese performs Flying Sawblade Slicer, defend it and then grab him 
and do Super Mongolian Fire Tuckle, if he defends Super Mongolian Fire 
Tuckle, then do Big Discus Bash right away. And do this over and over, 
when you have a little life bar left, wait again and when he uses his 
Flying Sawblade Slicer, grab him then do Mongolian Temjin-Renbu. When 
Geese is far away, take your time to recharge, and when he jumps, do not 
do A+C, but do Wall of No Return. Pretty much easy.

  Temjin will not be able to perform Super Mongolian Fire Tuckle and 
Mongolian Temjin-Renbu when he loses his Rage Gauge. And can perform all 
his Special Moves. Geese will not defend Wall of No Return, Super 
Mongolian Fire Tuckle and Mongolian Temjin-Renbu and will always defend 
Mongolian Tornade Dive and Mongolian Renbu-Ken. 
 
  Be fully careful here, Geese performs his Special Move, Hard Blow, A 
LOT. So, focus on the strategy if you do not want to get kicked. 

++++++++++++++++++++
Perfect Possibility:
++++++++++++++++++++
  The strategy will be pretty much complicated for those who do not like 
Temjin and not used to choose him. But it is a very fun and good 
strategy to beat Geese. With the above strategy, you can get perfectwith 
having fun and doing something very hard to do. 

  The possibility to get perfect is 85%

++++++++++++++
Beating Geese:
++++++++++++++
  This fight is pretty tough for Eiji to get perfect, be there is a very 
hard starategy to get perfect.

  Anyway, when the match starts, Geese will throw a Reppu Ken if you do 
not move, do fast Steel Cutter Wave when the match starts. Then go grab 
him, if he recovers then do either Kasumi Kiri or Ryu Kei Jin, do not... 
and I mean DO NOT do his Ki Kou Hou if he recovers from the throw... 
because he sometimes defends it... and when he defends it, he will do 
crouching hard kick and you really do not want him to do that, do you?

  If he did not recover from the throw, fast do his Ki Kou Hou... Geese 
will get dizzy. Then do Steel Cutter Wave, run and then grab him and 
then recharge when he recovers from the throw, and if did not then fast 
run and do Ki Kou Hou. Do not bother when he hits you... just defend and 
then when you have a little life bar left... grab Geese after he 
performs Flying Sawblade Slicer, then do Zantetsu Touro Ken. Do it fast 
because sometimes Geese break it by his crouching hard punches. 

  Eiji cannot perform Zantetsu Touro Ken, Steel Cutter Wave when he 
loses his Rage Gauge. Geese will not defend Ki Kou Hou (sometimes), Ryu 
Kei Jin, Kasumi Kiri, Steel Cutter Wave, Zantetsu Touro Ken. And will 
defend if you do Pegasus Kick, Koppakiri and Kisaragiryu-Renbu-Ken. 

++++++++++++++++++++
Perfect Possibility:
++++++++++++++++++++
  If you want a sure perfect to beat Geese. Then when the match begins, 
fast do Steel Cutter Wave and Geese will throw a Reppu Ken at you, but 
the Steel Cutter Wave will hit him, then wait for him to throw another 
Reppu Ken and then break it by your crouching light kick and stay. He 
will recharge and then do it over, over and over again. Just do the 
same... so he throws a Reppu Ken then you break it by crouching light 
kick, then he will recharge and throw another Reppu Ken and you will 
break it again by your crouching light kick and so on.

  Sometimes he gets very mad at the end of the match and gets a little 
near you to throw his Reppu Ken, do not worry. Continue with the same 
method and in the last five seconds he will get very near and perform 
many Reppu Kens without charging, so just stay calm and crouching light 
kick to each Reppu Ken. But he does not go off like this so much... so 
do not worry. You just have to hit him with your Steel Cutter Wave then 
break all the Reppu Kens with your crouching light kicks. 

  The possibility to get perfect is 43%

  John... heh, okay... a fact is a fact. John owns everyone if we talk 
about fighting the CPU. He owns all for free and can get as many perfect 
matches as he can with no trouble. He owns Mr. Big and Geese for free. 
He is a powerhouse compared to them. But if vs. human, they own him for 
free and eat him alive. 

  I have many strategies to get perfect with John. Okay when the match 
starts, jump back to avoid being hit by Geese's Reppu Ken, then Geese 
will jump and then do standing hard kick... HERE, before he performs it, 
run and grab him, BE SO FAST. Then everything will be easy from here. 
the first method is, Geese will be falling in the corner where you want 
him to be in. 

  Before he gets up, do Spiral Leg Bomber... he will not defend it. Then 
do it over, over and over again until he dies. This is the first method. 
The second method is when he falls, get near him and do crouching hard 
kick. He will not defend it... do it over, over and over again until he 
dies. 

  The third method is when he falls from your grab, go near him and then 
crouching hard kick then grab him. If he recovers, then fast do 
crouching hard kick and if not then do Mega Smash. He will get dizzy, do 
the same thing over and over again until he dies. 

  The fourth method is when you grab him do Mega Smash if he did not 
recover and then Mega Smasher, then always crouching hard kick. And if 
he recovered from the throw then do Mega Smasher and then always keep up 
with the crouching hark kicks until he dies. 

  The last well-known method is when the match starts, fast do Spiral 
Leg Bomber. He will do Reppu Ken... you will not hit each other, you 
will find yourselves near each other. Fast, crouch and then hard kick 
then run backward and crouch... he will throw Reppu Ken, then break it 
by your crouching light kick. And he will recharage and do the same 
thing again and you just keep up with breaking his Reppu Kens with your 
crouching light kick until the match finishes. 

  Geese will ne defend Mega Smash, Spiral Leg Bomber, Mega Smasher (low) 
and Atomic Smash (sometimes). And will defend Atomic Smash (sometimes), 
Over Drive Kick, Flying Attack and Mega Smasher (mid and high). John 
will not be able to perform Atomic Smash and Mega Smasher when he loses 
his Rage Gauge.

++++++++++++++++++++
Perfect Possibility:
++++++++++++++++++++
  See? John is pretty easy to use and so easy to beat all the CPU 
fighters with many perfect matches (if not all). If you want to reach 
Geese so fast, then choose John.

  The possibility to get perfect is 100%

  The little Mickey is no less than his friend, John. But John is the 
master of beating the CPU. 

  Mickey's grab cannot be recovered because he punches you. So, he is 
good. And Mickey has an infinity. A very handy thing. 

  When the match starts, fast jump back to avoid the Reppu Ken, Geese 
will jump and then standing hard kick, here, you have to run and grab 
him before he hits with his standing hard kick. Then when you grab him, 
run again before he gets up and then grab him again... or you can walk 
and then before he gets up, grab him. You have to time everything to 
perfect it. It is a very good infinity. This is a sure perfect. 

  You can grab him and then do Rolling Upper over and over again until 
you lose your Rage Gauge, and then run to grab again until he dies. And 
you can have fun by doing one time Rolling Upper and then grab... then 
Comet Gale and then grab. Have fun and you still will get perfect. The 
only trouble that Mickey has, is that he cannot break the low Special 
Moves. Like Geese's Reppu Ken... he must do the Rolling Upper in order 
to break it. 

  Mickey will not be able to perform Comet Gale, Rush Bomber and Crazy 
Upper when he loses his Rage Gauge. Geese will not defend Rush Bomber, 
Comet Gale, Burning Upper and Rolling Upper (sometimes). He will block 
Chopping Right, Crazy Upper, Combination 1 and Combination 2.

  The big fatty dumb guy is good against Geese too. 

  Jack owns Geese for free because he can finish him off SO FAST and 
with a very sure perfect. When the match starts Geese will do Reppu Ken, 
and of course in that time you will do Super Drop Kick, Geese will not 
defend. Then grab Geese before he gets up, he will most of the time not 
recover... do Knuckles of Fury, he will get dizzy the do the same thing 
over and over again until you see he has so little life bar left... then 
do Super Hip Attack for fun. 

  If he recovers, then run then crouching hard kick and continue with 
the same above method. This is very methodic if you want a very fast 
perfect. The fastest in the game. 

  Another good method is when the match starts, do Super Drop Kick, then 
fast run backward and then do it again. Geese will never defend it. You 
then just have to do it over and over again until he dies. 
  
  Another well-known method is when the match begins, fast crouch and 
Geese will throw a Reppu Ken at you, then break it by your crouching 
light kick and stay. He will charge and then do it over, over and over 
again. Just do the same... so he throws a Reppu Ken then you break it by 
crouching light kick, then he will recharge and throw another Reppu Ken 
and you will break it again by your crouching light kick and so on.

  When the time at five seconds, fast when he performs his Reppu Ken, 
just perform your Super Drop Kick and then run backward. 

  Geese will not defend Super Drop Kick, Super Hip Attack and Hell 
Diving. And will defend Jack The Dynamite, Bomber Dance and Knuckles of 
Fury (but not after you grab him). Jack will ne be able to perform Super 
Hip Attack and Hell Diving when he loses his Rage Gauge. His Brain Shock 
Punch is a complete waste of time, so do not bother with it.

Beating Geese:
++++++++++++++
  Lee suffers from Geese a lot. His moves do not work against Geese that 
much. And Geese breaks all his moves easily. Also his Super Move and 
Hidden Super Move do not work well if not used well, because Geese 
breaks them with his crouching hard punches or light punches easily. I 
do not know, but I think Geese hates Lee so much... like I do. 

  I will give you the most hard and sure strategy to get perfect, 
because it is very hard to get perfect with Lee. The hardest character 
that can take on Geese with a very sure perfect... anyway, on with it.      

  When the match begins, stand still... Geese will throw a Reppu Ken. 
Just jump up to avoid it. Geese then will walk to you, walk to him and 
easily grab him... then go backward and crouch... then he will do the 
same thing over again, you just have to do the same. Keep this up until 
he dies, but it will get difficult when the time runs out. He will 
change his pattern. So, you only need to always back off and focus on 
his movement. Or when you grab him, just go backward and wait for the 
Reppu Ken then break it by crouching light kick and do the same until 
the time runs out and you win.   

  Geese does not block Hawk's Talon Dropping (sometimes). And he blocks 
and punches Flying Monkey Claw (a lot of times, but if not it will hit 
him), Super Talon Slice, Kacyu Mowan Kick, The Hundred Blows of Hurt and 
Iron Talon Slice. Lee will not be able to perform The Hundred Blows of 
Hurt, Super Talon Slice and Flying Monkey Claw when he loses his Rage 
Gauge.

++++++++++++++++++++
Perfect Possibility:
++++++++++++++++++++
  Hey, kidding. ^_^ how about an easy way to beat Geese and get a sure 
perfect? So, do not worry. How about telling you about it? 

  When the match begins, Geese will throw a Reppu Ken, jump up to avoid 
it... then he will walk to you, just walk to him and calmly grab. Then 
walk to him and B+C when he gets up. Then grab him and walk to him then 
B+C before he gets up and do this method over and over again until he 
dies. 

  Okay, okay... how about a very easy way? When the match begins, jump 
up to avoid Geese's Reppu ken, then he will walk to you, just walk to 
him and then grab him... then he will fall in the corner. WALK to him 
then B+C, stand still and when he gets up, again B+C. Do this method 
over and over again until he dies. Pretty damn cheap, eh?

  Geese really breaks everything that Lee has, but still Lee has some 
methods that can take him on. 

  The possibility to get perfect is 95%

  Big Vs. Geese...! Doesn't this sound so evilish? One of the best 
matches...

  When the match begins Geese will throw Reppu Ken, so you fast do Cross 
Diving, then when he gets up... grab him and then throw a Ground 
Blaster. He will get dizzy, grab him again and then throw your Ground 
Blaster and continue with this method until he dies and you get perfect.

  There is another one, when the match begins jump up to avoid the Reppu 
Ken. He will walk to you, just walk to him and then grab him and then 
throw Ground Blaster to make him get dizzy... recharge and then do 
Ground Blaster until you lose your Rage Gauge thern fast recharge, Geese 
will only jump... if he does so, then A+C and then Ground Blaster again 
until you lose your Rage Gauge... continue with this easy method until 
hem dies. 

  Geese does not block Ground Blaster, Dram Shot (most of the time) and 
Rising Spear. He blocks Cross Diving, Spinning Lancer and Blaster Wave 
(most of the time). Big will not be able to perform Rising Spear and 
Blaster Wave when he loses his Rage Gauge. 

++++++++++++++++++++
Perfect Possibility:
++++++++++++++++++++
  A very easy and sure perfect to Big. 

  The possibility to get perfect is 100%

The Full Percentage:
--------------------
 So, you know what full percentage. But the percentage changes... it 
depends if you want to play cheap, use a strategy or do anything to get 
perfect (Perfect Fight Percentage)... or play and just kill Geese 
without carrying about the perfect (Normal Fight Percentage). It will be 
like this...

===========================
Beating Geese - Percentage:
===========================
Name      P.F.P.   N.F.P.
===========================
Ryo        64%      73%
===========================
Robert    100%      89%
===========================
Yuri       23%      67%
===========================
Takuma    100%      93%
===========================
King       98%      75%
===========================
Temjin     85%      88%
===========================
Eiji       43%      82%
===========================
John      100%     100%
===========================
Micky     100%     100%
===========================
Jack      100%     100%
===========================
Lee        95%      54%
===========================
Big       100%     100%
===========================
 
=====================================================

-----------------
Characters Order:
-----------------
 The order to reach everyone is not random. It depends on whom you 
choose "first". It is fun to know who you will reach everytime, 
depending on the first character you chose to fight against. Example, I 
do not like Lee and I love King's theme, I fight him first and then I 
will get King in the eleventh match. 

  You just have to know the order so that you could make everything as 
want it to be. Unfortunately Jack is the only one who does not seem to 
appear in the last matches. He always appears in 2nd, and 3rd stage... 
and one in 4th and one in 6th stage. 

  The best order is Lee's... every fight after him seems to get more 
better and greater. Anyway, see and decide. This will help you a lot to 
reach Geese.

Questions & Answers:
--------------------
  This section is for those who E-Mailed me about a thing or two about 
Geese or some aspects, instead of e-mailing them back, I will answer 
here so that nobody would ask the same questions again:

=====
Maha:
=====
Q: Hey there, Basoooly! Yer really somethin', ya 'no? This's one of da 
best FAQs I've ever read in this site. No wonder ya like Geese! I got a 
question... w'ere da ya put Geese in the da ranking? Over or under-
rated?

A: Thanks...! It is good sometimes to see people thanking me for what I 
do for them! As for your question, well... it is stupid to make him 
under anyone. He is on top of everybody with no exception. Mickey and 
Mr. Big come in the fifth and sixth place after him. Yup, pretty much 
good.

======
Tariq:
======
Q: Hey there, Basol! May you just tell us AGAIN how to reach Geese?

A: Easy and simple, Trooq. Do not lose any round... and if you did, let 
the 2nd player come in and then knock him out and continue. With Mr. 
Big, if you lose one round (after you win the first round) you will 
still be able to reach Geese. So, this is pretty much it. 

=====
URWN:
=====
Q: Hi, Mr. Basel. Do you still remember me? I have a question. Did 
Takuma really kill Jeff Bogard? And if not, then how come he knows him? 
And why most of they guys say so? I will take your word since you are 
the best one I know that knows many things about this game!

A: Yeah, I still remember you URWN (Your Worst Nightmare)! About your 
question, NO! Takuma did not kill or have anything to do with Jeff 
Bogard. Geese is the one who did it. SNK proved it in Fatal Fury Wild 
Ambition. Even in the first Fatal Fury's manual, it says Geese did. 

  Those who say Takuma did are really drunk. In Art of Fighting, Geese 
does not even know who Jeff was (read his ending in Art of Fighting 2). 
Only on Nintendo, they screwed up everything, which I care not about. 
But in the story of Art of Fighting Takuma had to fight his own son, 
because he was forced to. His daughter was kidnapped for God's sake!

  Read what happened in Art of Fighting 2 after "To Be Continued" in Art 
of Fighting;

  One year before...

Yuri: Stop, Ryo. That guy with the big nose is...

  Yes. The guy with the big beak was Ryo and Yuri's father! Takuma 
Sakazaki who fled the dreaded Southtown syndicate and the powerful 
figure who led this dreaded bunch of thugs. For his breaking of the 
group code, Mr. Big kidnapped Yuri. Holding her histage to lure the 
unsuspecting Mr. Karate, Takuma Sakazaki, into a trap involving Robert 
and Ryo.

  See? Takuma might (a big might) fought Jeff, but no way killed him. 
And I am saying this only because Takuma said something about Jeff in 
the King of Fighters'94... nothing else. Takuma is so pure, he cannot 
kill a fly... unlike Geese who would kill his mother to reach what he 
wants. 

  Even after clearing everything in Wild Ambition and how Ryo got old... 
still, I believe there is no connection between Art of Fighting and 
Fatal Fury. The other thing they have in common is that they both have 
the same tournament... which is The King of Fighters. 

  If those guys are saying crap about this sensitive subject then let me 
make many holes in their laughable theories:

1)Geese entered the King of Fighters'96 and was aged, unlike the Art of 
Fighting characters who were still young, may any explain this?

2)In King of Fighters'96, the Art of Fighting team never cared about the 
Boss team and did not say anything in their ending... did not they fight 
Geese in Art of Fighting 2?

3)Geese and Big seemed so friendly in King of Fighters'96, why did not 
Big ask Geese; "Man, we were at the same age back in AoF, what happened 
to you... you are over-aged!" instead of bullshitting about shotting 
Geese, because he fooled him?

  Puzzling, eh? Yup... no body cares! It should be in the 70's, but SNK 
changed the timeline and placed the Art of Fighting characters at the 
same age as the characters from Fatal Fury series (90's) to fit in the 
King of Fighters series, but that does not change anything. It does not 
ring a bell, because of Geese! Also, still, Ryo is aged in Fatal Fury: 
Wild Ambition and Buriki One In Tokyo. So again, who cares?!

=====================================================

---------
Fun Fact:
---------
  People seem to misunderstand many things. I just heard that SNK 
screwed some endings when they translated them to English. Like Eiji's, 
in the Japanese ending he was only training, but in the English ending 
he was saying crap about Mai. 

  I do not get it why the guys make it as if it is a big deal and as if 
SNK screwed the ending! Wake up, smart heroes. Eiji REALLY has something 
to towards Mai and AGAINST Andy Bogard... not because of the ending, but 
because it seems that Andy kicked his sorry @$$ before... if you want a 
powerful prove then read Eiji's background. He even appears in Mai's 
backstage in Fatal Fury Special!

  I cannot believe it, I waste my time on writing many important things, 
and it seems nobody is reading! I feel so sorry. And who said "he's in 
love" or anything? Even if SNK USA came up with it, I will go with them 
since I do not understand Japanes, and I never cared to! 

  I do not think either is wrong... I think we are the only ones to 
blame since we come up with theories all the time! And that's a bull!
